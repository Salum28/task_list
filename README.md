# Task List App

The following project was made in a Flutter course i made, and the main goals of this app were:

* Learn how to store, read and delete data in a JSON file stored in your device;
* Learn how to use Dismissible Widget and Snackbar to cancel a delete action;

Also, one of the app's goals was to pratice layout creation and customization.
## How the App Works

When you inicialize the app, you will see a floating action button, when you click in it, a Alert Dialog will show with a text field in it, so you can write your task, and you will see two buttons, one to cancel the action and close the dialog, and other to save the task.

When you save the task, a JSON File containing the tasks that you saved will be created and saved in your device, and the tasks that you saved will be shown in your screen.

To delete a task just slide the task to the right, when you do that, a snackbar will appear if you want to cancel the action, but if you wait 5 seconds, the snackbar will disapear and you won't be able to restore the task that you deleted.
